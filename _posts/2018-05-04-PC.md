title: What I learned from being QIP PC chair
---

I was recently chair of the program committee for QIP 2018, and since
I started the process by writing past chairs for advice, I thought I'd
write down my own thoughts with the hope that they might be useful
later.

Reflections on the QIP PC process:

What I think went well.

Use deputy chair to act as chair on papers which I reviewed, since it is hard for me to both moderate a discussion and engage in it while arguing with other reviewers.

More bids.

Clearer guidance on subreviewers - maybe you can write your own report too.

Quicker focus on borderline papers. 

Topic balance in PC selection


Hi Aram,

Related to your comment at the QIP business meeting: In principle, there
exists software to help organizing parallel tracks by asking the
attendees beforehand what they want to hear, and adjust the tracks
accordingly. This is done at a large hacker congress in Germany called
Chaos Computer Congress.

The software is here:

https://halfnarp.events.ccc.de/
https://events.ccc.de/2014/11/25/lets-do-the-halfnarp/

With some hacking, it might not be too hard to adjust to QIP needs, but
it's possibly an overkill.

Thanks again for your work as QIP PC chair, it was a great program!

Cheers,
Chris

Policy Questions:

anonymous submissions not so popular.  This post argues that they may not help anyway.

QIP discussions and later reviewing.  Should editors for journals be
connected informally to either QIP reviewers or at least members of
the PC who would have access to the QIP reviews?
Cons: groupthink, violates principles of fault-tolerance.
