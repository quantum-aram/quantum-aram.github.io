message: "Thanks so much for putting these thoughts together and making them publicly available.  They are great resources for future PC chairs.  The comments also make the review process more transparent for the QIP community.  I hope this starts a good tradition and in the long term, it may be worth-while to take a small amount of funding from QIP to host a permanent website for such valuable information. \r\n\r\n* On anonymous submission: personally I am in favor of making it mandatory.  To be more precise, I am in favor of taking the authors' identities out of most of the review process.  I will give two reasons, suggest some solutions, and discuss some potential problems. \r\n\r\nThe first motivation is to take the competition closer to a level playing field.  While reviews are conducted in good faith, there can still be implicit biases, possibly systematically favoring more well-known researchers.  It is true that authorship information is often publicly available, and the reviewers could have seen presentations of the results before the reviews; however, an active reminder on the authors' identities seems counterproductive.\r\n\r\nThe second motivation is to improve the discussion.  While reviewers with clear COIs are excluded from the discussion of the corresponding submissions, for a small field, a typical reviewer can be involved in a substantial number of discussions concerning several close former collaborators or groupmates.  I have recently heard from a colleague that he/she will be uncomfortable discussing a paper in the presence of a close ally of the authors.  I think not having the authors' information can help. \r\n\r\nOf course, anonymous submissions will not completely resolve the above problems, but I hope that are some first steps. \r\n\r\nThe downside, of course, is the logistics.  I would wish there is a way for Easychair to manage COI at the level of assigning the submissions.  But then if the reviewers seek subreviewers, I am afraid the most obvious candidates are the authors themselves!  I do not know how this is being handled elsewhere, but there are other CS conferences that have adopted the mandatory anonymous system (including Crypto) so perhaps it is worth investigating.  Alternatively, the chair and co-chairs can be a trusted party to oversee accidental COIs.\r\n\r\nOur situation is close to some theoretical CS conferences, so, perhaps we can borrow some of their thoughts and lessons, such as discussed in the following:\r\n\r\nhttps://windowsontheory.org/2018/01/11/on-double-blind-reviews-in-theory-conferences/\r\nhttp://mybiasedcoin.blogspot.com/2018/01/double-blind-alenex.html\r\nhttp://blog.geomblog.org/2018/01/report-on-double-blind-reviewing-in.html\r\nhttp://blog.geomblog.org/2018/01/double-blind-review-at-theory.html\r\n\r\nThere are some studies for larger medical journals, but they may not be applicable to us:\r\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5213965/#CR12 .\r\n\r\nI will not be religious about stated amount of difference, but I hope the above provides some thoughts for future discussion.\r\n\r\nI am intrigued by one thought, that perhaps one can let the author's information be available but not immediately so.  For example, one may have to ask Easychair before the information will be displayed, so, it can still be used when considering subreviewerss, but the information can be prompted forgotten afterwards.  Having the information in the smallest possible font hidden as a footnote on the last page may work too.  In any case, I do not see any reason for names and institutes of authors to be display prominently on the submission (I have personally often removed institute information on the 3-page abstracts, in the least that saves space for the actual science). \r\n\r\n* COI is tricky.  We do not want people too close to the authors to review, but we also want strong expertise.  A more radical view is that, out of 3 reviews, allowing up to one review with a minor COI (same institute or a recent collaborator in exchange of more expertise) can be valuable; since the \"majority\" of the reviews are still arm's length, and biases will show up quite clearly.  How interesting a subject is and how incremental the result looks like vary a lot from one small subcommunity to another.  I think having opinions and discussions from a more diverse group of reviewers can be useful.  Given the ridiculous number of subjects the PC has to cover, there may be very few experts of a subject, and excluding them due to minor COIs can result in a less fair process.\r\n\r\n* I second the policy that subreviewers should not enter scores.\r\n\r\n* Papers with no bids probably can be assigned to one dedicated reviewer, who can then decide if further reviews are needed.\r\n\r\n* I agree the moderator should not be one of the reviewers.\r\n\r\n* I will include an additional issue, from a discussion with a former PC chair.  PC members seem to vary a lot in their level of \"generosity\".  Some PC members were said to have accepted up 50% of the assignments, while the instruction was to accept paper in par with the better half of the previously presented works,.  I wonder if the variation was exceptional or a norm; if so, whether there are methods to mitigate the problem.\r\n\r\n* I think there should be clear statement what community QIP is serving, and what are the goals.  The field is shifting so much in just the last 2-3 years ...  Perhaps the scientific committee can initiate some thoughts and a more thorough discussion be brought up in the next 1-2 QIPs involving also former attendees who may be absent. \r\n\r\n* Cost should be kept low, and there is more value to a more open event with more social interaction (like the rump session and poster sessions) them a sat-down evening with pre-scheduled speeches or performances.  Given that people stay for 4-5 nights at best, with a potential evening for industrial expo, and possibly one rump session, there may be too little time for attendees to explore collaborations etc."
